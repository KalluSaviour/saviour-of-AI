Aim: - To Implement and Analysis of BFS and DFS for Application

Algorithm:-

1) Create a node list (Queue) that initially contains the first node N and mark it as visited.
2) Visit the adjacent unvisited vertex of N and insert it in queue.
3) If there are no adjacent vertices left, remove the first vertex from the queue mark it as visited, display it.
4) Repeat the step 1 and step 2 until the queue is empty or the desired node is found.
